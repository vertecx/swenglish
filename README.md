# Swenglish
The Swedish keyboard layout is in many ways suboptimal for programming and system administration. Many common special characters are typed using a modifier key (Shift or hard to reach AltGr) while the Swedish characters å, ä and ö are easily accessible but seldom used.

Searching for an alternative, one might stumble across the US ANSI keyboard layout where most special character used in programming are easily accessible. Most notably:

* Brackets and curly bracers are easier to type.
* Both Windows ( \ ) and Unix ( / ) path separators can be typed without a modifier key.
* Semicolon requires no modifier key.

Learning US ANSI (and Swenglish) is relatively easy as it shares the placement of all letters and digits with the Swedish keyboard layout. One only has to relearn the placement of the special characters.

Compared to the US International keyboard layout, Swenglish borrows the placement of the å, ä and ö characters from the Swedish keyboard layout. The characters are typed by using the AltGr modifier key.

A bonus advantage gained from switching to a US ANSI keyboard is that the range of mechanical keyboards gets much bigger!  :smiley:
